What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

The git merge command integrates separate code developments into a single
branch without compromising the history of the individual developments. The
git rebase command rebases the current branch you are working on to make it seem 
as if you had orginally created the branch from the other commit that you 
are rebasing too. This then would not preserve the whole history as merge
does but instead create a linear effect where the new branch is attached to 
the main branch and moving forward from there.
